# Social Engineering in the Wild

## Abstract

Social engineering in the wild aims to collect and model social engineering techniques that target social media users in the State of Kuwait. 
The purpose of this work is to study methods that are successful in reaching the target demographic. The observation is that users of different demographics
exhibit different behaviors and respond to distinct ways in social engineering. 
The current effort revolves around phishing attacks through phone calls, emails, SMS messages, or WhatsApp messages. Our initial results indicate
that attackers use a wide variety of techniques and also show persistence in pursuing their victims. Further, these messages, despite showing clear
indicators of phishing attempt, were not detected by prominent social media applications on either iOS or Android.
